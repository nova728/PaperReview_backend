While fine-grained, aspectwise evaluations provide valuable diagnostic information, they are difficult to design exhaustively, and each aspect's contribution to the overall acceptability of an answer is unclear. In this study, we propose a method to compute an overall quality score as a weighted average of three key aspects: factuality, informativeness, and formality. This approach achieves stronger correlations with human judgments compared to previous metrics. Our analysis identifies factuality as the most predictive aspect of overall quality. Additionally, we release a dataset of 1.2k long-form QA answers annotated with both absolute judgments and relative preferences in overall and aspect-wise schemes, to aid future research in evaluation practices. github.com/gokamoda/lfqa-weighted-eval\n\n请从以下几个方面进行评审：\n1. 研究意义和创新性\n2. 技术方法的合理性\n3. 实验设计和结果分析\n4. 论文写作和表达\n5. 总体评价和建议\n\n请提供详细的评审意见："
