            "We introduce PaSa, an advanced Paper Search agent powered by large language models. PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholarly queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4 for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50. It also exceeds PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.

It requires long-tail specialized knowledge, comprehensive survey-level coverage, and the ability to address fine-grained queries. For instance, consider the query: \"Which studies have focused on non-stationary reinforcement learning using value-based methods, specifically UCB-based algorithms?\" While widely used academic search systems like Google Scholar are effective for general queries, they often fall short when addressing these complex queries (Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2020). Consequently, researchers frequently spend substantial time conducting literature surveys (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021).",

Bran et al., 2024), writing code (Xu et al., 2022), and generating research papers (Shao et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). One of the most fundamental yet critical stages in research is conducting academic surveys. Despite its importance, current tools like Google Scholar are often insufficient, leading researchers to spend considerable time on literature review tasks (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021, 2020). This challenge motivates us to develop PaSa, an LLM agent designed to autonomously and comprehensively assist researchers in collecting relevant research papers for complex scholarly queries.",

In addition to realizing LLM Agents through prompt engineering (Park et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), recent research has focused on optimizing and training these agents (Feng et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Among these efforts, AGILE (Feng et al., 2024), a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents, allows the joint optimization of all agent skills in an end-to-end manner. In our work, we adopt the AGILE framework to implement PaSa. Specifically, we design a novel session-level PPO algorithm to address the unique challenges of the paper search task, including sparse rewards and long trajectories.",

When compared to the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa-7b achieves an improvement of 33.80%, 38.83% and 42.64% in Recall@20, Recall@50 and Recall@100, respectively.",

PaSa is implemented within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents. To train PaSa, we developed AutoScholarQuery, a dataset of fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers drawn from top-tier AI conference publications. To evaluate PaSa in real-world scenarios, we also constructed RealScholarQuery, a dataset of actual academic queries paired with annotated papers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaSa outperforms all baselines, including Google, Google Scholar, and Google with GPT-4o, ChatGPT, GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o. In particular, PaSa-7B surpasses Google with GPT-4o by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50, while also exceeding PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. These findings underscore PaSa significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of academic search.",
