            "Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the realization of artificial general intelligence."

Based on large-scale pre-training on massive text corpora and reinforcement learning from human feedback [2], LLMs can exhibit superior capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning. The powerful capability of LLMs also drives many emergent research topics (e.g., in-context learning [1, 7, 8], instruction learning [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and chain-of-thought prompting [15, 16, 17, 18]) to further investigate the huge potential of LLMs, and brings unlimited possibilities for us for advancing artificial general intelligence.",

We discuss them from these aspects: 1) Limited to the input and output forms of text generation, current LLMs lack the ability to process complex information such as vision and speech, regardless of their significant achievements in NLP tasks; 2) In real-world scenarios, some complex tasks are usually composed of multiple sub-tasks, and thus require the scheduling and cooperation of multiple models, which are also beyond the capability of language models; 3) For some challenging tasks, LLMs demonstrate excellent results in zero-shot or few-shot settings, but they are still weaker than some experts (e.g., fine-tuned models). How to address these issues could be the critical step for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence.",

Hence, the pivotal question is how to choose suitable middleware to bridge the connections between LLMs and AI models. To tackle this issue, we notice that each AI model can be described in the form of language by summarizing its function. Therefore, we introduce a concept: \"Language as a generic interface for LLMs to collaborate with AI models\". In other words, by incorporating these model descriptions into prompts, LLMs can be considered as the brain to manage AI models such as planning, scheduling, and cooperation. As a result, this strategy empowers LLMs to invoke external models for solving AI tasks. However, when it comes to integrating multiple AI models into LLMs, another challenge emerges: solving numerous AI tasks needs collecting a large number of high-quality model descriptions, which in turn requires heavy prompt engineering. Coincidentally, we notice that some public ML communities usually offer a wide range of applicable models with well-defined model descriptions for solving specific AI tasks such as language, vision, and speech. These observations bring us some inspiration: Can we link LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) with public ML communities (e.g., GitHub, Hugging Face) for solving complex AI tasks via a language-based interface?",

By executing models and integrating results in the planned tasks, HuggingGPT can autonomously fulfill complex user requests. The whole process of HuggingGPT, illustrated in Figure 1, can be divided into four stages: • Task Planning: Using ChatGPT to analyze the requests of users to understand their intention, and disassemble them into possible solvable tasks. • Model Selection: To solve the planned tasks, ChatGPT selects expert models that are hosted on Hugging Face based on model descriptions. • Task Execution: Invoke and execute each selected model, and return the results to ChatGPT. • Response Generation: Finally, ChatGPT is utilized to integrate the predictions from all models and generate responses for users.",

HuggingGPT applies LLMs as the brain for planning and decision, and automatically invokes and executes expert models for each specific task, providing a new way for designing general AI solutions. 2. By integrating the Hugging Face hub with numerous task-specific models around ChatGPT, HuggingGPT is able to tackle generalized AI tasks covering multiple modalities and domains. Through the open collaboration of models, HuggingGPT can provide users with multimodal and reliable conversation services. 3. We point out the importance of task planning and model selection in HuggingGPT (and autonomous agents), and formulate some experimental evaluations for measuring the capability of LLMs in planning and model selection. 4.

LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, as well as more complex tasks such as mathematical problems and commonsense reasoning, due to their massive corpus and intensive training computation. To extend the scope of large language models (LLMs) beyond text generation, contemporary research can be divided into two branches: 1) Some works have devised unified multimodal language models for solving various AI tasks [21, 22, 23]. For example, Flamingo [21] combines frozen pre-trained vision and language models for perception and reasoning. BLIP-2 [22] utilizes a Q-former to harmonize linguistic and visual semantics, and Kosmos-1 [23] incorporates visual input into text sequences to amalgamate linguistic and visual inputs. 2) Recently, some researchers started to investigate the integration of using tools or models in LLMs [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Toolformer [24] is the pioneering work to introduce external API tags within text sequences, facilitating the ability of LLMs to access external tools. Consequently, numerous works have expanded LLMs to encompass the visual modality. Visual ChatGPT [26] fuses visual foundation models, such as BLIP [29] and ControlNet [30], with LLMs. Visual Programming [31] and ViperGPT [25] apply LLMs to visual objects by employing programming languages, parsing visual queries into interpretable steps expressed as Python code. More discussions about related works are included in Appendix B.",

Benefiting from the design of task planning in HuggingGPT, our system can automatically and effectively generate task procedures and solve more complex problems; 3) HuggingGPT offers a more flexible approach to model selection, which assigns and orchestrates tasks based on model descriptions. By providing only the model descriptions, HuggingGPT can continuously and conveniently integrate diverse expert models from AI communities, without altering any structure or prompt settings. This open and continuous manner brings us one step closer to realizing artificial general intelligence.",

Moreover, we require the LLM to determine dependencies and execution orders for these decomposed tasks, to build their connections. To enhance the efficacy of task planning in LLMs, HuggingGPT employs a prompt design, which consists of specification-based instruction and demonstration-based parsing. We introduce these details in the following paragraphs.",

As shown in Table 1, the task parsing template comprises four slots (\"task\", \"id\", \"dep\", and \"args\") to represent the task name, unique identifier, dependencies and arguments. Additional details for each slot can be found in the template description (see the Appendix A.1.1).

By incorporating dependencies among tasks, these demonstrations aid HuggingGPT in understanding the logical connections between tasks, facilitating accurate determination of execution order and identification of resource dependencies. The details of our demonstrations is presented in Table 1. Furthermore, to support more complex scenarios (e.g., multi-turn dialogues), we include chat logs in the prompt by appending the following instruction: \"To assist with task planning, the chat history is available as {{ Chat Logs }}, where you can trace the user-mentioned resources and incorporate them into the task planning.\". Here {{ Chat Logs }} represents the previous chat logs. This design allows HuggingGPT to better manage context and respond to user requests in multi-turn dialogues.",

However, due to the limits of maximum context length, it is not feasible to encompass the information of all relevant models within one prompt. To mitigate this issue, we first filter out models based on their task type to select the ones that match the current task. Among these selected models, we rank them based on the number of downloads on Hugging Face and then select the top-K models as the candidates.

It is necessary to emphasize the issue of resource dependencies at this stage.

HuggingGPT parsed these into six tasks, including pose detection, text-to-image conditional on pose, object detection, image classification, image captioning, and text-to-speech. We observed that HuggingGPT can correctly orchestrate the execution order and resource dependencies among tasks. For instance, the pose conditional text-to-image task had to follow pose detection and use its output as input. After this, HuggingGPT selected the appropriate model for each task and synthesized the results of the model execution into a final response. For more demonstrations, please refer to the Appendix A.3.",

Therefore, we deem that the quality of task planning can be utilized to measure the capability of LLMs as a controller in HuggingGPT. For this purpose, we conduct quantitative evaluations to measure the capability of LLMs. Here we simplified the evaluation by only considering the task type, without its associated arguments. To better conduct evaluations on task planning, we group tasks into three distinct categories (see Table 2) and formulate different metrics for them:",

We consider the planning to be correct if and only if the task name (i.e., \"task\") and the predicted label are identically equal. In this context, we utilize F1 and accuracy as the evaluation metrics. • Sequential Task indicates that the user's request can be decomposed into a sequence of multiple sub-tasks. In this case, we employ F1 and normalized Edit Distance [35] as the evaluation metrics. • Graph Task indicates that user requests can be decomposed into directed acyclic graphs. Considering the possibility of multiple planning topologies within graph tasks, relying solely on the F1-score is not enough to reflect the LLM capability in planning. To address this, following Vicuna [36], we employed GPT-4 as a critic to evaluate the correctness of the planning. The accuracy is obtained by evaluating the judgment of GPT-4, referred to as the GPT-4 Score. Detailed information about the GPT-4 Score can be found in Appendix A.1.5.",

Specifically, in more complex tasks (e.g., sequential and graph tasks), GPT-3.5 has shown absolute predominance over other LLMs. These results also demonstrate the evaluation of task planning can reflect the capability of LLMs as a controller.

Table 7 reports the planning results under the different variety of demonstrations. We observe that increasing the variety among demonstrations can moderately improve the performance of LLMs in conduct planning. Moreover, Figure 3 illustrates the results of task planning with different number of demonstrations. We can find that adding some demonstrations can slightly improve model performance but this improvement will be limited when the number is over 4 demonstrations.

Consequently, we cannot ensure that the generated plan will always be feasible and optimal. Therefore, it is crucial to explore ways to optimize the LLM in order to enhance its planning abilities; 2) Efficiency poses a common challenge in our framework. To build such a collaborative system (i.e., HuggingGPT) with task automation, it heavily relies on a powerful controller (e.g., ChatGPT). However, HuggingGPT requires multiple interactions with LLMs throughout the whole workflow and thus brings increasing time costs for generating the response; 3) Token Lengths is another common problem when using LLM, since the maximum token length is always limited. Although some works have extended the maximum length to 32K, it is still insatiable for us if we want to connect numerous models. Therefore, how to briefly and effectively summarize model descriptions is also worthy of exploration; 4) Instability is mainly caused because LLMs are usually uncontrollable. Although LLM is skilled in generation, it still possibly fails to conform to instructions or give incorrect answers during the prediction, leading to exceptions in the program workflow. How to reduce these uncertainties during inference should be considered in designing systems.",

By exploiting the advantages of LLMs in understanding and reasoning, HuggingGPT can dissect the intent of users and decompose it into multiple sub-tasks. And then, based on expert model descriptions, HuggingGPT is able to assign the most suitable models for each task and integrate results from different models to generate the final response.
