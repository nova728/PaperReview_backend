            "It is the most important way for researchers to acquire academic progress via reading scientific papers, most of which are in PDF format. However, existing PDF Readers like Adobe Acrobat Reader and Foxit PDF Reader are usually only for reading by rendering PDF files as a whole, and do not consider the multi-granularity content understanding of a paper itself. Specifically, taking a paper as a basic and separate unit, existing PDF Readers cannot access extended information about the paper, such as corresponding videos, blogs and codes. Meanwhile, they cannot understand the academic content of a paper, such as terms, authors, and citations. To solve these problems, we introduce Hammer PDF, an intelligent PDF Reader for scientific papers. Apart from basic reading functions, Hammer PDF has the following four innovative features: (1) information extraction ability, which can locate and mark spans like terms and other entities; (2) information extension ability, which can present relevant academic content of a paper, such as citations, references, codes, videos, blogs, etc; (3) built-in Hammer Scholar, an academic search engine based on academic information collected from major academic databases; (4) built-in Q&A bot, which can find helpful conference information. The proposed Hammer PDF Reader can help researchers, especially those studying computer science, to improve the efficiency and experience of reading scientific papers. We have released Hammer PDF, available at https://pdf.hammerscholar.net/face."

Specifically, taking a paper as a basic and separate unit, existing PDF Readers cannot access extended information about the paper, such as corresponding videos, blogs and codes. Meanwhile, they cannot understand the academic content of a paper, such as terms, authors and citations. For example, when a paper is opened through Adobe Reader, researchers can only read the paper itself, and cannot obtain the extended content such as its corresponding videos, tutorial blogs and implementation codes. If a researcher wants to know: \"Where is the corresponding code/video/blogs? What is the meaning of a word? What about authors? Where is the full text of a reference?\", he has to use other tools such as browsers, translators, web search engines or scholar search engines to find the answers, which is tedious and tend to interrupt the reading process, and thus is very low efficient. Why do not we use only one tool to accomplish all these functions? Thus, to tackle these above problems, this paper will introduce Hammer PDF, a multi-platform intelligent PDF Reader for scientific papers, to improve the efficiency and experience of reading PDF documents through machine learning and academic search. The proposed Hammer PDF Reader is available for both web and desktop applications (Windows, macOS, and Linux). Hammer PDF has four new features as follows:",

Meanwhile, these PDF Readers do not perform any content analysis, which fails to meet the intelligent needs of reading academic papers. As a result, several new PDF Readers focusing on mining academic value of scientific papers have come out recently. ScholarPhi [3, 4] argues that it is often difficult to read articles when the information researchers need to understand them is scattered across multiple paragraphs. Thus, ScholarPhi 3 identifies terms and symbols in an article through fine-grained analysis and allows users to access their definitions. ReadPaper 4 focuses on academic communication through literature management and notes sharing, along with simple paper search functions through coarse-grained analysis. However, the academic database of ReadPaper is lacking in content to meet complex reading demands.",
