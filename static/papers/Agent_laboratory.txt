            "Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages—literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery."

Lu et al.

Even though these works demonstrate that current LLMs can generate ideas judged to be more novel than those produced by human experts, Si et al. (2024) indicates that LLMs still exhibit weaknesses in feasibility and implementation details, suggesting a complementary rather than replacement role for LLMs in research.

We introduce Agent Laboratory, an open-source LLM agent framework for accelerating the individual's ability to perform research in machine learning. In order to accommodate all users, Agent Laboratory is compute flexible, where various levels of compute can be allocated based on the individual's access to compute resource (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory) and model inference budget. 2. Human evaluators rated papers generated using Agent Laboratory across experimental quality, report quality, and usefulness, showing that while the o1-preview backend was perceived as the most useful, o1-mini achieved the highest experimental quality scores, and gpt-4o was behind in all metrics. 3. NeurIPS-style evaluations showed that o1-preview performed best among backends, particularly in clarity and soundness, according to human reviewers. However, a clear gap emerged between human and automated evaluations, with automated scores significantly overestimating quality (6.1/10 vs. 3.8/10 overall). Similar discrepancies were seen across clarity and contribution metrics, suggesting the need for human feedback to complement automated evaluations for more accurate assessments of research quality. 4. Co-pilot mode in Agent Laboratory was evaluated on custom and preselected topics, showing higher overall scores compared to autonomous mode. Co-pilot papers also saw trade-offs in experimental quality and usefulness, reflecting challenges in aligning agent outputs with researcher intent. 5. The co-pilot feature in Agent Laboratory is overall found to have high utility and usability when rated by human users, with most participants deciding to continue usage after their experience. 6. Detailed cost and inference time statistics, as well as the breakdown of cost per paper phase, are presented for different model back-ends, demonstrating that Agent Laboratory offers automatic research at a greatly reduced price compared with other works (only $2.33 USD per paper with a gpt-4o backend). 7. State-of-the-art performance on a subset of MLE-Bench challenges using the proposed mle-solver, achieving higher consistency and scoring compared to other solvers, and earning more medals, including gold and silver, than MLAB, OpenHands, and AIDE.",

The reward model, invoked as an LM, scores the program on a scale from 0 to 1 considering the outlined research plan, the produced code, and the observed output to determine how accurately the program adheres to the initial goals. A score of 1 is provided for results with high alignment and everything below on a spectrum of how closely the output and code matches the planning goals. This process is similar to existing methods for LLM reasoning tree search (Yao et al. (2024)), where instead of a series of reasoning steps being traversed using self-evaluated LLM scoring, the set of possible programs are being traversed (via EDIT and REPLACE commands) and the resulting program outcome is self-evaluated to determine if a program is worth building on.

If it successfuly compiles and returns a score, the solver will reflect on how to increase this score.

In top program sampling, a collection of the highest-scoring programs is maintained, and one program is randomly sampled before executing a command, ensuring diversity while retaining quality. For batch-parallelization, each solver step involves making N modifications simultaneously, with the top modification selected to replace the lowest-scoring program in the top collection. These strategies use high-entropy sampling to modify the code, resulting in a balance between exploration of new solutions and refinement of existing ones in order to maintain stable code modifications.",

Moderate gains were also observed in clarity (+0.23) and presentation (+0.33). In contrast, some metrics showed minimal or no improvement. Significance declined slightly (-0.05), and contribution increased only marginally (+0.03). Our results suggest that papers generated with human involvement overall are evaluated more highly than autonomously generated paper, with much of the focus of human involvement going toward making the paper more presentable (presentation and clarity) while there was less emphasis on improving experimental results (significance and contribution). Finally, we note that co-pilot overall scores, which average at 4.38, are still -1.45 points below the average score of 5.85 for an accepted paper at NeurIPS 2024. Increasing the overall score to match conference standards will likely result by improving the contribution and significance of the paper results, which is consistently lower than other evaluation metrics.",

In order to evaluate mle-solver more objectively, we use a subset of 10 ML challenges from MLE-Bench (Chan et al. (2024)). MLE-Bench is a benchmark designed to assess the capability of agents in handling real-world ML tasks on Kaggle competitions. This benchmark compares agent performances with human baselines, scoring agents with Kaggle's medal system, and incorporating mechanisms to mitigate contamination and plagiarism risks. We include all challenges focusing on text and tabular data from the low complexity category of MLE-Bench. We provide as input to mle-solver the following: Kaggle dataset description, distilled knowledge from Kaggle notebooks, as well as an accessible train and dev set. Instead of using an LLM scoring function, the mle-solver score is evaluated on the dev set, which is a 20% random sample taken from the original training set, and the training set is represented by the other 80% split. All data (dev, test, train) is placed into arrays using the numpy library instead of providing file locations in order to better emulate the data preparation phase. Once all mle-solver steps have concluded, the final code with the highest score is evaluated on the actual Kaggle test set and a benchmark score is recorded.",

We thus calculated average scores by excluding invalid submissions from other works and averaging valid ones. We find that Agent Laboratory's mle-solver is more consistently high scoring than other solvers, with mle-solver obtaining four medals (two gold, one silver, and one bronze) compared with OpenHands (gpt-4o) obtaining two medals (two gold), AIDE (o1-preview) obtaining two medals (one gold, one bronze) and MLAB obtaining zero medals. Additionally, mle-solver obtained above median human performance on six out of ten benchmarks, with AIDE obtaining five out of ten, OpenHands two out of ten, and MLAB zero out of ten.

(2024b)), qualitatively research reports from Agent Laboratory are less satisfying than research papers from The AI Scientist (Lu et al. (2024b)), with ours having lower quality figures, despite Agent Laboratory papers obtaining higher scores overall. (2) The research reports produced by Agent Laboratory are not meant to replace the paper writing process done by humans as it was in The AI Scientist, rather it is meant to provide a report for the human to understand what has been accomplished, so that they can scale up the experiment and write their own research report. However, we nonetheless use NeurIPS reviewer scores as the heuristic for the quality of our presented paper-solver, which aims to evaluate the reports from the perspective of a complete research paper. Additionally, contrasting with Lu et al. (2024b) demonstrate that LLMs perform less reliably for self-evaluation compared with human reviewers, with lower agreement scores (53.3% vs. 56.1%). Although LLMs demonstrate reasonable consistency, this may stem from reliance on superficial patterns rather than robust evaluation criteria, resulting in discrepancies between LLM and human rankings.

Another limitation is that mle-solver and paper-solver are limited to generating only two figures for the paper. This can be solved in future work, by allowing all of the figures generated by the mle-solver (without restriction) to be incorporated into paper-solver by detecting image files and providing those paths to the solver. Agent Laboratory is also not able to manage repository-level code on its own, but rather the appropriate files are provided to it at each necessary step and files are saved based on which phase produced the file.

This had to be detected and removed manually. • mle-solver has been observed to run system commands on the host computer using the subprocess.run() command. While nothing problematic has been observed, safeguards should be implemented around this. • paper-solver often struggles to search for relevant papers using the arXiv engine.

Because of this, we present results from human-centered experiments. Our initial evaluations focused on the quality of generated papers in autonomous mode, assessing human evaluations of experimental and report quality, usefulness, as well as reviewer scores based on standard academic criteria across different language models. We also assessed the effectiveness of Agent Laboratory in co-pilot mode, comparing its performance with autonomous mode, receiving positive feedback from researchers.",

The co-pilot feature in Agent Laboratory is overall found to have high utility and usability when rated by human users, with most participants deciding to continue usage after their experience.
